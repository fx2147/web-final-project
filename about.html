      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a college student who has grown through tutoring, dance, and community leadership.
        Teaching and performing help me connect with people, while my volunteer work has taught
        me how to organize projects and support others.

        <h3>Learning, movement, and community</h3>
        <p>
          I started tutoring classmates in high school and quickly realized how much I enjoy
          explaining concepts in a way that makes sense. Dance has been part of my life for
          many years as well. Performing and teaching choreography have given me confidence
          in front of groups and helped me learn how to communicate nonverbally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I bring together academic skills, creativity, and leadership experience to
          support students in different spaces: the classroom, the studio, and community events.

    <section class="leadership-section">
      <h2>Leadership &amp; Community Impact</h2>
      <p>
        During high school, I founded the Great Neck chapter of 
        <strong>AYLUS (Alliance of Youth Leaders in the United States)</strong>,
        a national volunteer organization that encourages youth to lead community service
        and educational initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is listed under the official founding members on the organization’s website:

          AYLUS Great Neck Chapter

      <h2>Dance Gallery</h2>
      <p>
        Dance has always been a space where I can express emotions that are difficult 
        to put into words. These photos capture a few moments that mean a lot to me.

        Aside from performing, I teach beginner and youth dance sessions. This short video captures
